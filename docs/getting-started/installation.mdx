## Install FastMCP

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install and manage FastMCP.

```bash
pip install fastmcp
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv add fastmcp
```

### Optional Dependencies

FastMCP provides optional extras for specific features. For example, to install the background tasks extra:

```bash
pip install "fastmcp[tasks]"
```

See [Background Tasks](/servers/tasks) for details on the task system.

### Verify Installation

To verify that FastMCP is installed correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
fastmcp version
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
$ fastmcp version

FastMCP version:                           3.0.0
MCP version:                               1.25.0
Python version:                            3.12.2
Platform:            macOS-15.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit
FastMCP root path:            ~/Developer/fastmcp
```

### Dependency Licensing

<Info>
FastMCP depends on Cyclopts for CLI functionality. Cyclopts v4 includes docutils as a transitive dependency, which has complex licensing that may trigger compliance reviews in some organizations.

If this is a concern, you can install Cyclopts v5 alpha which removes this dependency:

```bash
pip install "cyclopts>=5.0.0a1"
```

Alternatively, wait for the stable v5 release. See [this issue](https://github.com/BrianPugh/cyclopts/issues/672) for details.

## Upgrading

### From FastMCP 2.x

See the [Upgrade Guide](/getting-started/upgrading/from-fastmcp-2) for a complete list of breaking changes and migration steps.

### From FastMCP 1.0 (in the Low-Level SDK)

If you're using FastMCP 1.0 via the `mcp` package (`from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP`), upgrading is straightforward — for most servers, it's a single import change. See the [full upgrade guide](/getting-started/upgrading/from-mcp-sdk) for details.

### From the Low-Level Server API

If you built your server directly on the `mcp` package's `Server` class — with `list_tools()`/`call_tool()` handlers and hand-written JSON Schema — see the [migration guide](/getting-started/upgrading/from-low-level-sdk) for a full walkthrough.

## Versioning Policy

FastMCP follows semantic versioning with pragmatic adaptations for the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem. Breaking changes may occur in minor versions (e.g., 2.3.x to 2.4.0) when necessary to stay current with the MCP Protocol.

For production use, always pin to exact versions:
```
fastmcp==3.0.0  # Good
fastmcp>=3.0.0  # Bad - may install breaking changes
```

See the full [versioning and release policy](/development/releases#versioning-policy) for details on our public API, deprecation practices, and breaking change philosophy.

### Looking Ahead: FastMCP 4.0

The MCP Python SDK v2 is expected in early 2026 and will include breaking changes. When released, FastMCP will incorporate these upstream changes in a new major version (FastMCP 4.0).

To avoid unexpected breaking changes, we recommend pinning your dependency with an upper bound:

```
fastmcp>=3.0,<4
```

We'll provide migration guidance when FastMCP 4.0 is released.
