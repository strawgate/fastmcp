# `fastmcp.server.mixins.mcp_operations`


MCP protocol handler setup and wire-format handlers for FastMCP Server.

## Classes

### `MCPOperationsMixin` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/mixins/mcp_operations.py#L90" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


Mixin providing MCP protocol handler setup and wire-format handlers.

Note: Methods registered with SDK decorators (e.g., _list_tools_mcp, _call_tool_mcp)
cannot use `self: FastMCP` type hints because the SDK's `get_type_hints()` fails
to resolve FastMCP at runtime (it's only available under TYPE_CHECKING). When
type hints fail to resolve, the SDK falls back to calling handlers with no arguments.
These methods use untyped `self` to avoid this issue.
