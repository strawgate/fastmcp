# `fastmcp.server.providers.aggregate`


AggregateProvider for combining multiple providers into one.

This module provides `AggregateProvider`, a utility class that presents
multiple providers as a single unified provider. Useful when you want to
combine custom providers without creating a full FastMCP server.

Example:
    ```python
    from fastmcp.server.providers import AggregateProvider

    # Combine multiple providers into one
    combined = AggregateProvider([provider1, provider2, provider3])

    # Use like any other provider
    tools = await combined.list_tools()
    ```


## Classes

### `AggregateProvider` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/providers/aggregate.py#L41" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


Utility provider that combines multiple providers into one.

Components are aggregated from all providers. For get_* operations,
providers are queried in parallel and the highest version is returned.

Errors from individual providers are logged and skipped (graceful degradation).

This is useful when you want to combine custom providers without creating
a full FastMCP server.
