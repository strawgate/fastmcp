## Classes

### `SkillsDirectoryProvider` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/providers/skills/directory_provider.py#L19" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


Provider that scans directories and creates a SkillProvider per skill folder.

This extends AggregateProvider to combine multiple SkillProviders into one.
Each subdirectory containing a main file (default: SKILL.md) becomes a skill.
Can scan multiple root directories - if a skill name appears in multiple roots,
the first one found wins.

**Args:**
- `roots`: Root directory(ies) containing skill folders. Can be a single path
or a sequence of paths.
- `reload`: If True, re-discover skills on each request. Defaults to False.
- `main_file_name`: Name of the main skill file. Defaults to "SKILL.md".
- `supporting_files`: How supporting files are exposed in child SkillProviders\:
- "template"\: Accessed via ResourceTemplate, hidden from list_resources().
- "resources"\: Each file exposed as individual Resource in list_resources().
