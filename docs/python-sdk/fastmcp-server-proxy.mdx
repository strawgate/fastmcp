# `fastmcp.server.proxy`


Backwards compatibility - import from fastmcp.server.providers.proxy instead.

This module re-exports all proxy-related classes from their new location
at fastmcp.server.providers.proxy. Direct imports from this module are
deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
