## Functions

### `get_task_capabilities` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/tasks/capabilities.py#L20" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
get_task_capabilities() -> ServerTasksCapability | None
```


Return the SEP-1686 task capabilities.

Returns task capabilities as a first-class ServerCapabilities field,
declaring support for list, cancel, and request operations per SEP-1686.

Returns None if pydocket is not installed (no task support).

Note: prompts/resources are passed via extra_data since the SDK types
don't include them yet (FastMCP supports them ahead of the spec).
