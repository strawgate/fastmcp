<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

The central piece of MCP client applications is the `fastmcp.Client` class. This class provides a **programmatic interface** for interacting with any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, handling protocol details and connection management automatically.

The FastMCP Client is designed for deterministic, controlled interactions rather than autonomous behavior, making it ideal for:

- **Testing MCP servers** during development
- **Building deterministic applications** that need reliable MCP interactions  
- **Creating the foundation for agentic or LLM-based clients** with structured, type-safe operations

All client operations require using the `async with` context manager for proper connection lifecycle management.


<Note>
This is not an agentic client - it requires explicit function calls and provides direct control over all MCP operations. Use it as a building block for higher-level systems.
</Note>

## Creating a Client

Creating a client is straightforward. You provide a server source and the client automatically infers the appropriate transport mechanism.

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

# In-memory server (ideal for testing)
server = FastMCP("TestServer")
client = Client(server)

# HTTP server
client = Client("https://example.com/mcp")

# Local Python script
client = Client("my_mcp_server.py")

async def main():
    async with client:
        # Basic server interaction
        await client.ping()
        
        # List available operations
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        resources = await client.list_resources()
        prompts = await client.list_prompts()
        
        # Execute operations
        result = await client.call_tool("example_tool", {"param": "value"})
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Client-Transport Architecture

The FastMCP Client separates concerns between protocol and connection:

- **`Client`**: Handles MCP protocol operations (tools, resources, prompts) and manages callbacks
- **`Transport`**: Establishes and maintains the connection (WebSockets, HTTP, Stdio, in-memory)

### Transport Inference

The client automatically infers the appropriate transport based on the input:

1. **`FastMCP` instance** → In-memory transport (perfect for testing)
2. **File path ending in `.py`** → Python Stdio transport
3. **File path ending in `.js`** → Node.js Stdio transport  
4. **URL starting with `http://` or `https://`** → HTTP transport
5. **`MCPConfig` dictionary** → Multi-server client

```python
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

# Examples of transport inference
client_memory = Client(FastMCP("TestServer"))
client_script = Client("./server.py") 
client_http = Client("https://api.example.com/mcp")
```

<Tip>
For testing and development, always prefer the in-memory transport by passing a `FastMCP` server directly to the client. This eliminates network complexity and separate processes.
</Tip>

## Configuration-Based Clients

<VersionBadge version="2.4.0" />

Create clients from MCP configuration dictionaries, which can include multiple servers. While there is no official standard for MCP configuration format, FastMCP follows established conventions used by tools like Claude Desktop.

### Configuration Format

```python
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "server_name": {
            # Remote HTTP/SSE server
            "transport": "http",  # or "sse" 
            "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp",
            "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer token"},
            "auth": "oauth"  # or bearer token string
        },
        "local_server": {
            # Local stdio server
            "transport": "stdio",
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["./server.py", "--verbose"],
            "env": {"DEBUG": "true"},
            "cwd": "/path/to/server",
        }
    }
}
```

### Multi-Server Example

```python
config = {
    "mcpServers": {
        "weather": {"url": "https://weather-api.example.com/mcp"},
        "assistant": {"command": "python", "args": ["./assistant_server.py"]}
    }
}

client = Client(config)

async with client:
    # Tools are prefixed with server names
    weather_data = await client.call_tool("weather_get_forecast", {"city": "London"})
    response = await client.call_tool("assistant_answer_question", {"question": "What's the capital of France?"})
    
    # Resources use prefixed URIs
    icons = await client.read_resource("weather://weather/icons/sunny")
    templates = await client.read_resource("resource://assistant/templates/list")
```

## Connection Lifecycle

The client operates asynchronously and uses context managers for connection management:

```python
async def example():
    client = Client("my_mcp_server.py")
    
    # Connection established here
    async with client:
        print(f"Connected: {client.is_connected()}")
        
        # Make multiple calls within the same session
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
        
    # Connection closed automatically here
    print(f"Connected: {client.is_connected()}")
```

## Operations

FastMCP clients can interact with several types of server components:

### Tools

Tools are server-side functions that the client can execute with arguments.

```python
async with client:
    # List available tools
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    
    # Execute a tool
    result = await client.call_tool("multiply", {"a": 5, "b": 3})
    print(result.data)  # 15
```

See [Tools](/v2/clients/tools) for detailed documentation.

### Resources

Resources are data sources that the client can read, either static or templated.

```python
async with client:
    # List available resources
    resources = await client.list_resources()
    
    # Read a resource
    content = await client.read_resource("file:///config/settings.json")
    print(content[0].text)
```

See [Resources](/v2/clients/resources) for detailed documentation.

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable message templates that can accept arguments.

```python
async with client:
    # List available prompts
    prompts = await client.list_prompts()
    
    # Get a rendered prompt
    messages = await client.get_prompt("analyze_data", {"data": [1, 2, 3]})
    print(messages.messages)
```

See [Prompts](/v2/clients/prompts) for detailed documentation.

### Server Connectivity

Use `ping()` to verify the server is reachable:

```python
async with client:
    await client.ping()
    print("Server is reachable")
```

### Initialization and Server Information

When you enter the client context manager, the client automatically performs an MCP initialization handshake with the server. This handshake exchanges capabilities, server metadata, and instructions. The result is available through the `initialize_result` property.

```python
from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="MyServer", instructions="Use the greet tool to say hello!")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet a user by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

async with Client(mcp) as client:
    # Initialization already happened automatically
    print(f"Server: {client.initialize_result.serverInfo.name}")
    print(f"Version: {client.initialize_result.serverInfo.version}")
    print(f"Instructions: {client.initialize_result.instructions}")
    print(f"Capabilities: {client.initialize_result.capabilities.tools}")
```

#### Manual Initialization Control

In advanced scenarios, you might want precise control over when initialization happens. For example, you may need custom error handling, want to defer initialization until after other setup, or need to measure initialization timing separately.

Disable automatic initialization and call `initialize()` manually:

```python
from fastmcp import Client

# Disable automatic initialization
client = Client("my_mcp_server.py", auto_initialize=False)

async with client:
    # Connection established, but not initialized yet
    print(f"Connected: {client.is_connected()}")
    print(f"Initialized: {client.initialize_result is not None}")  # False

    # Initialize manually with custom timeout
    result = await client.initialize(timeout=10.0)
    print(f"Server: {result.serverInfo.name}")

    # Now ready for operations
    tools = await client.list_tools()
```

The `initialize()` method is idempotent - calling it multiple times returns the cached result from the first successful call.

## Client Configuration

Clients can be configured with additional handlers and settings for specialized use cases.

### Callback Handlers

The client supports several callback handlers for advanced server interactions:

```python
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.logging import LogMessage

async def log_handler(message: LogMessage):
    print(f"Server log: {message.data}")

async def progress_handler(progress: float, total: float | None, message: str | None):
    print(f"Progress: {progress}/{total} - {message}")

async def sampling_handler(messages, params, context):
    # Integrate with your LLM service here
    return "Generated response"

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    log_handler=log_handler,
    progress_handler=progress_handler,
    sampling_handler=sampling_handler,
    timeout=30.0
)
```

The `Client` constructor accepts several configuration options:

- `transport`: Transport instance or source for automatic inference  
- `log_handler`: Handle server log messages
- `progress_handler`: Monitor long-running operations
- `sampling_handler`: Respond to server LLM requests
- `roots`: Provide local context to servers
- `timeout`: Default timeout for requests (in seconds)

### Transport Configuration
